All of the exercises I've done when I was taking the PNAIPS course in my fourth semester. 
All the exercises (except the ones with FINKIAPSBOOK as the package), were from FINKI courses.
The FINKIAPSBOOK ones can be found in the book that is usually located at the top of the course, just use CTRL+F to find the task and explanation for it. I've added a comment that is the name of the exercise at the top of the code for every exercise.

Best of luck!
